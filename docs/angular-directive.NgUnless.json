{"name":"NgUnless","qualifiedName":"angular-directive.NgUnless","comment":"<p>The <code>ng-unless</code> directive complements the <code>ng-if</code> (provided by\n<a>angular-directive.NgIf</a>) directive.</p>\n<p>The <code>ng-unless</code> directive recreates/destroys the DOM subtree containing the\ndirective based on the <strong>falsy/truthy</strong> value of the provided expression.\nSpecifically, if the expression assigned to <code>ng-unless</code> evaluates to a <code>true</code>\nvalue, then the subtree is removed from the DOM.  Otherwise, <em>a clone of the\nsubtree</em> is reinserted into the DOM.  This clone is created from the compiled\nstate.  As such, modifications made to the element after compilation (e.g.\nchanging the <code>class</code>) are lost when the element is destroyed.</p>\n<p>Whenever the subtree is inserted into the DOM, it always gets a new child\nscope.  This child scope is destroyed when the subtree is removed from the\nDOM.  Refer\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/The-Nuances-of-Scope-prototypical-Inheritance prototypical inheritance</p>\n<p>This has an important implication when <code>ng-model</code> is used inside an\n<code>ng-unless</code> to bind to a javascript primitive defined in the parent scope.\nIn such a situation, any modifications made to the variable in the\n<code>ng-unless</code> subtree will be made on the child scope and override (hide) the\nvalue in the parent scope.  The parent scope will remain unchanged by changes\naffected by this subtree.</p>\n<p>Note: <code>ng-unless</code> differs from <code>ng-show</code> and <code>ng-hide</code> in that <code>ng-unless</code>\ncompletely removes and recreates the element in the DOM rather than changing\nits visibility via the <code>display</code> css property.  A common case when this\ndifference is significant is when using css selectors that rely on an\nelement's position within the DOM (HTML), such as the <code>:first-child</code> or\n<code>:last-child</code> pseudo-classes.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- By using ng-unless instead of ng-show, we avoid the cost of the\n     showdown formatter, the repeater, etc. --&gt;\n&lt;div ng-unless=\"terseView\"&gt;\n   {{obj.details.markdownText | showdown}}\n   &lt;div ng-repeat=\"item in obj.details.items\"&gt;\n     ...\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>","isAbstract":false,"superclass":"dart-core.Object","implements":[],"subclass":[],"variables":{},"inheritedVariables":{},"methods":{"setters":{"condition=":{"name":"condition=","qualifiedName":"angular-directive.NgUnless.condition=","comment":"","commentFrom":"angular-directive._NgUnlessIfAttrDirectiveBase.condition=","inheritedFrom":"","static":false,"abstract":false,"constant":false,"return":[{"outer":"void","inner":[]}],"parameters":{"value":{"name":"value","optional":false,"named":false,"default":false,"type":[{"outer":"dynamic","inner":[]}],"value":null,"annotations":[]}},"annotations":[]}},"getters":{},"constructors":{"":{"name":"","qualifiedName":"angular-directive.NgUnless.NgUnless-","comment":"","commentFrom":"","inheritedFrom":"","static":false,"abstract":false,"constant":false,"return":[{"outer":"dynamic","inner":[]}],"parameters":{"boundViewFactory":{"name":"boundViewFactory","optional":false,"named":false,"default":false,"type":[{"outer":"angular-core-dom_internal.BoundViewFactory","inner":[]}],"value":null,"annotations":[]},"viewPort":{"name":"viewPort","optional":false,"named":false,"default":false,"type":[{"outer":"angular-core-dom_internal.ViewPort","inner":[]}],"value":null,"annotations":[]},"scope":{"name":"scope","optional":false,"named":false,"default":false,"type":[{"outer":"angular-core_internal.Scope","inner":[]}],"value":null,"annotations":[]}},"annotations":[]}},"operators":{},"methods":{}},"inheritedMethods":{"setters":{"condition=":{"name":"condition=","qualifiedName":"angular-directive.NgUnless.condition=","comment":"","commentFrom":"","inheritedFrom":"angular-directive._NgUnlessIfAttrDirectiveBase.condition=","static":false,"abstract":true,"constant":false,"return":[{"outer":"void","inner":[]}],"parameters":{"value":{"name":"value","optional":false,"named":false,"default":false,"type":[{"outer":"dynamic","inner":[]}],"value":null,"annotations":[]}},"annotations":[]}},"getters":{"hashCode":{"name":"hashCode","qualifiedName":"angular-directive.NgUnless.hashCode","comment":"<p>Get a hash code for this object.</p>\n<p>All objects have hash codes.
